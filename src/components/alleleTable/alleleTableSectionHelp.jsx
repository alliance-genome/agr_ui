      An allele is one of multiple possible forms of a functional genomic element (most
      often described as a locus or a gene), differing from the reference DNA sequence.
      The genomic element can be endogenous or constructed. The change(s) present in a
      given allele is effectively described by genomic variant(s). See a <ExternalLink href="https://twitter.com/alliancegenome/status/1379572405765570560" target="_blank"> brief tutorial</ExternalLink>.
