      Genetic interactions (e.g., phenotypic suppression, epistasis) between
      genes (and genetic perturbations) are available for genes from humans
      and 7 out of 8 Alliance model organism species (excluding Xenopus tropicalis).
      Alliance genetic interaction data are provided by two Alliance Knowledge
      Centers (WormBase and FlyBase), as well as an external interaction database, BioGRID.
