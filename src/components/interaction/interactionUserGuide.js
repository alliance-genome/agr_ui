      interactions) between genes and gene products are available for
      genes from humans and all six Alliance model organism species. Alliance
      interaction data are provided by two Alliance Knowledge Centers
      (WormBase and FlyBase), as well as two external interaction
      databases, <ExternalLink href='https://thebiogrid.org'>BioGRID</ExternalLink> and
