      There are three precomputed stringency options, described below. Note
      that not all the included methods have been applied to all the species
      within the Alliance, so the maximum counts differ for different pairs
      of species.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>1) Stringent (default)</b><br />
      Primary criterion: An ortholog called by 3 or more methods is included
      if it is a best count OR a best reverse count.<br />
      Secondary criteria: An ortholog predicted by ZFIN or HGNC is always
      included, regardless of count.An ortholog called by 2 methods is
      included if it is both a best count AND a best reverse count.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>2) Moderate</b><br />
      Primary criterion: An ortholog called by 3 or more methods is included
      (regardless of best or best reverse status). <br />
      Secondary criteria (no change): An ortholog predicted by ZFIN or HGNC is
      always included, regardless of count. An ortholog called by 2 methods is
      included it is both a best count AND a best reverse count.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>3) No filter</b><br />
      All orthologs are included.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the 3 precomputed options must be selected. The additional options
      are designed to further constrain the results of the selected precomputed
      option. For maximum flexibility, select the "No filter" option.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to stringency options, a specific species may be selected
      and/or a specific method may be selected. Note that the "Hide additional
      filters" button does NOT remove those filters. To remove additional filters
      the "Reset filters" button must be used.
