  'This gene description is generated by an algorithm developed by the Alliance that uses highly structured gene data such as associations to various ontology terms (e.g., Gene Ontology terms) and the Alliance strict orthology set. The original set of ontology terms that a gene is annotated to may have been trimmed to an ancestor term in the ontology, in order to balance readability with the amount of information in the description. The complete set of annotations to this gene may be found in the relevant data tables below.';
