  <p>
    We provide downloadable files of the gene descriptions for each species in
    JSON, TSV and TXT formats. Please note that the template for sentences for
    the gene descriptions contains semicolons in between the ontology terms,
    and not commas. This is because some ontology terms contain a comma within
    them, so having commas within ontology terms and in between ontology terms
    affects readability of the description. JSON files contain the gene
    descriptions along with metadata such as total numbers of: genes with
    descriptions (non-null), ontology terms for each data type and average
    number of terms per description. The complete JSON schema with the
    documented list of fields can be found at <a href="https://github.com/alliance-genome/agr_schemas/tree/master/ingest/genedescription">GitHub</a>.
