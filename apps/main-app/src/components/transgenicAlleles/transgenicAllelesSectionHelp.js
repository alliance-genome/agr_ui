    A transgene is a segment of genetic material (DNA) that has been
    artificially introduced into an organism. The term "transgene" is
    often used to describe a piece of foreign DNA that has been inserted
    into the genome of an organism through genetic engineering techniques.
    The transgene can come from any species, or another strain of that
    species, and can contain any desired sequence of DNA, including genes
    that confer specific traits or characteristics to the organism. Once
    introduced into the genome, the transgene becomes a permanent part of
    the organism's DNA and can be passed down to future generations.
