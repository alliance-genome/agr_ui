    <p>
      Gene expression data include temporal and/or spatial localization
      of transcripts and proteins in a wild-type background. These
      annotations are summarized in the Expression Ribbon. Darker cells
      have more annotations; white cells lack annotations, either because
      none exist or the structure does not exist in that organism. The
      underlying annotations can be viewed by clicking in a ribbon cell.
      Expression data from orthologs can be added to the ribbon and table
      by using the orthologous gene selector found above the ribbon. Only
      orthologs with annotated expression data are available in the
      OrthoPicker. Links out to the member database for these data are also
      provided, as well as, when available, links to NCBIâ€™s GEO for
      high-throughput expression data for the gene.
