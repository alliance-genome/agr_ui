## Installation

1. This repo depends on nvm to manage Node.js versions. [Follow these instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to install nvm.
2. Run: `npm run local-init`
   - **Note**: If you are switching to a branch that uses vite from a branch that uses create react app or vise vesa, it is wise to run `rm -rf node_modules` (from the repo's root directory) first to avoid package version conflicts.
   - You may run into an issue with an "nvm: command not found" error, in that case, you can run these commands manually:
     - `nvm install`
     - `npm install`
     - `npm run generators`
3. You can now run the project locally in one of the following ways:
   - `npm start`: when you have the API running locally
   - `npm run start:test`: to connect to the test API
   - `npm run start:stage`: to connect to the stage API
   - `API_URL=[CUSTOM_URL_HERE] npm start`: for connecting to a custom API URL
4. Navigate to `localhost:3000` (or whichever port number is displayed in the console) to view the site

## AWS - Feature Branch Previews

Provides a way to verify the story in the test environment (without merging code). Once the branch is merged into test, the branch preview is deleted.

#### _GitHub_

Create a pull request of your branch KANBAN-# into test (_don't merge_).

#### _AWS_

Browse to https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=us-east-1#/

Click on the 'agr-ui-test' View App button

Look for your KANBAN-# branch and copy the url(eg: https://kanban-568.d39tao9vl33upy.amplifyapp.com/). Use this url for testing the story (send to curator), before merging code into the test branch. Once testing is complete, merge your branch into test.
